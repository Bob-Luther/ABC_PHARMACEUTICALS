# ABC Pharmaceutical Sales Analysis Dashboard üìä

## Project Overview
The project aims to improve sales performance and operational efficiency for ABC Pharmaceutical by conducting a detailed analysis of sales trends, customer behavior, and geographic impact on sales performance.

---

## Background
ABC Pharmaceutical operates in a highly competitive and regulated market, requiring precise strategies to enhance sales and distribution efficiency. With the growing complexity of data from different sources, ABC Pharmaceutical faces challenges in integrating and analyzing this information effectively. This project aims to leverage data analysis, geospatial insights, and advanced statistical methods to uncover hidden patterns, optimize product distribution, and refine marketing strategies.

---

## Problem Statement
ABC Pharmaceutical struggles to effectively analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product distribution across various regions and channels. This results in missed opportunities for targeting key customer segments and optimizing product offerings. There is a need for a comprehensive, data-driven approach to identify trends, understand customer purchasing patterns, and improve strategic decision-making.

## Project Objectives
- **Identify Sales Trends**: Analyze sales data over time to uncover peak periods and sales dips.
- **Understand Customer Behavior**: Identify key customer segments and analyze their purchasing behavior.
- **Evaluate Product Performance**: Assess product sales, identifying best-sellers and underperforming items.
- **Analyze Geospatial Impact**: Determine how geography affects sales and identify high/low performing regions.
- **Channel Performance**: Compare sales performance across different channels (Hospital vs. Pharmacy).
- **Optimize Sales Strategies**: Provide recommendations for refining sales strategies.
- **Enhance Product Offerings**: Suggest optimizations based on product performance and customer preferences.

## Hypotheses
1. **Hypothesis 1**: Higher product prices correlate with lower sales quantities.
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Sales performance varies significantly between customer channels (Hospital vs. Pharmacy).
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Sales are higher in urban areas compared to rural areas due to population density and healthcare infrastructure.
